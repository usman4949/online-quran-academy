            </div>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Online Quran Academy has
                    experienced Quran teachers teaching Muslims all across
                    the USA. The word Tafseer relates to ‘’learning the
                    meanings of words’’. It develops a better understanding
                    of the Quran and Hadith. Tafseer’s course is designed to
                    develop a general understanding of the commandments of
                    Allah that will provide divine direction to spend our
                    lives according to Allah’s will.</span></p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What is the Tafseer
                        course?</strong></span></h3>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Tafseer’s course involves
                    learning Ilmul Balagah, basic Arabic grammar rules, and
                    Usul-al-Tafsir with detail and comprehension. Tafseer
                    explains the surface knowledge of the Quran while Tawil
                    explains in-depth covert meanings of verses. However,
                    both of them are interconnected with each other. When
                    you learn Tafseer you automatically learn Tawil as
                    well.</span></p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>How can our experts
                        help you to learn the Tafseer
                        course?</strong></span></h3>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">We have designed the Tafseer
                    course for both adults and kids. Our certified Ulemas
                    connect different branches of science to explain the
                    meanings of verses. The dedicated teachers prefer to
                    consult authentic books of Hadith and Tafseer of widely
                    known scholars to strengthen their grip on the subject.
                    We deliver lectures via one-on-one live Skype sessions
                    with students by focusing on every minute detail. In the
                    end, the students will be able to write scholarly
                    articles with profound knowledge of the Quran and
                    Hadith. The students will be well-grounded to explain
                    the words of our beloved Prophet P.B.U.H, reports from
                    the tabi’un, and the opinion of the authentic Islamic
                    scholars.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Online Quran Academy is a
                    prominent Quran teaching institute in the USA. Our
                    experienced teachers have designed an online Quran
                    Tafseer course to interpret technical meanings of the
                    Quran verses. Our highly qualified teachers provide an
                    in-depth explanation of the verses of the Quran
                    according to different schools of thought of
                    Islam.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What Is Online Quran
                        Tafseer Course?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The literal meanings of
                    Tafseer include explanation, elucidation, or
                    interpretation. The authentic interpretation of Quranic
                    verses, chapters, or sections is called Tafseer of the
                    Quran. It involves the science of explanation of the
                    contextual meanings of the Quran in reference to
                    multiple books of Tafseer by known writers.
                    &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Tafseer responds to different
                    complexities of the learners for understanding the
                    Quran. For example, you get detailed insight about
                    revelation requirements, time, situation, and evolution
                    of the Islamic era. Hence, Muslims can understand the
                    prerequisites of Islam to acknowledge the commands of
                    Allah Almighty. One teacher focuses on one child at one
                    time that enhances the learning abilities of
                    students.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">The Holy Quran itself narrates
                    different stories and we explain those stories to
                    understand basic meanings. We use slideshows,
                    infographics, facts &amp; figures, and supportive
                    documents to explain the entire theme of the surahs. In
                    short, our students get sufficient knowledge to write
                    scholarly articles to support their ideas. Moreover, you
                    can teach other students after completion of this
                    course.</span></p>
